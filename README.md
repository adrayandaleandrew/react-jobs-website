# A Simple Job Website

This website displays jobs, create, delete, and edit job posting.

Goal of the website:
- Utilizing my knowledge in using ReactJS
- Familiarize myself in using components, props, routes, useStates, useEffects and etc.
- Learning and Applying the documentations I have read from TailwindCSS and Vite official website.
